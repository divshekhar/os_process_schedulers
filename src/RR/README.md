# RR

Round Robin

Round robin scheduling (RRS) is a job-scheduling algorithm that is considered to be very fair, as it uses time slices that are assigned to each process in the queue or line. Each process is then allowed to use the CPU for a given amount of time, and if it does not finish within the allotted time, it is preempted and then moved at the back of the line so that the next process in line is able to use the CPU for the same amount of time.
